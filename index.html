                <p>I was born in Nagoya-city located in the middle area of Japan near Kyoto and have spent my childhood in the Netherlands and the U.S. Influenced by the experience in the U.S., I have decided to study interpreting and translation in an university.</p>
                <p>My previous job was to look after the warehouse management system which was used all over the world and communicate with vendors about modifications and system problems. However, having no skills of IT nor coding, it was difficult for me to understand all the work and to take communication with vendors. Now having had a chance to learn coding here, I will be ready to work as a skilled sales engineer when I get back to Japan in 2022.</p>
